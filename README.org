#+Title: powerline

This version of powerline is forked from [[https://github.com/emmel/powerline][emmel's]] fork of [[https://github.com/Dewdrops/powerline][Dewdrops's]] fork of [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][milkypostman's powerline]], which was forked from [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/PowerLine][powerline.el from the Emacs Wiki]], which is in turn based off of [[https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline][Lokaltog's vim-powerline]].
It includes the changes in [[https://github.com/unic0rn/powerline][unic0rn's fork]] to better handle running in a terminal emulator.
I sincerely hope this chain doesn't get any longer.

** Features

- A theme designed to be used with Evil, which will change state tag's color according to current state (some code is stolen from [[https://github.com/laynor/emacs-conf/blob/master/packages/sm-package-powerline.el][this repo]]).

- Correctly handle =column-number-mode=, =size-indication-mode= etc.
  Local maps in mode line are properly set too.

- Retain as much as possible information of original mode line but still keep clean and simple.

- Support =which-function-mode=, [[https://github.com/bnbeckwith/wc-mode][wc-mode]], [[https://github.com/Bruce-Connor/paradox][paradox]] and [[https://github.com/tarsius/mode-line-debug][mode-line-debug-mode]].

** Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'powerline)
(powerline-evil-theme)
#+END_SRC

The second line customizes =mode-line-format= to mimick =vim-airline=, including Evil integration to colorize the modeline depending upon your current mode.
